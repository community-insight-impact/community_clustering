# Community_Clustering

* The repository code is an analysis of all the available features accumulated after merging data(on county level) from all the available sources.
* Here Clustering has been applied to group the data into groups . These groups are then analysed to find out the most important features contributing towards their grouping  i.e. which features are responsible for presence of any data piunt in one of the given groups.

##### The different clusters obtained are used as class labels for the data points and a supervised analysis if done to check the performance. 

* Then PCA is applied to get a better view at the clusters formed. Here are the clusters formed.

# Some of the features of individual clusters are:

### Cluster 1: 

### Cluster 2: 

### Cluster 3:
